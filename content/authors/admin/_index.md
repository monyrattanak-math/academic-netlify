My passion for mathematics was born since I was young and I always obtained good grade for math tests. This encourage me to study mathematics after high school.

I chose to do my master thesis related to Lie groups and Lie algebra under direction of <a href="https://www.cimat.mx/~quiroga/" target="_blank"> Dr. Raúl Quiroga Barranco</a>. Particularly, my topic is about <a href="https://cimat.repositorioinstitucional.mx/jspui/bitstream/1008/732/1/TE%20639.pdf" target="_blank"> Matrix Lie Groups and Lie Correspondences</a>. After obtaining master degree, I pursued my phd with the same adviser.

My phd dissertation focuses on commutativity of C*-algebras generated by families of Toeplitz operators, on weighted Bergman spaces, with symbols invariant under the action of subgroups of the biholomorphism groups of bounded symmetric domains. This allows me to use tools in represnatation theory of compact groups and Lie algebras to solve the problem.
