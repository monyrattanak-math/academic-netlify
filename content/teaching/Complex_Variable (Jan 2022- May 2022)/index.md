This is a one semester course on complex variables for MAC students cohort I. The reference used in the course is "COMPLEX VARIABLES AND APPLICATIONS, 8th edition" by James Ward Brown and Ruel V. Churchill. This course is intended to cover at least from chapter 1 to chapter 7.

The following is the link to join the class:

The homework have to be sent to my email (found it in About) with only one pdf file under the name "ComplexV_HW1" and so on. You are expected to work together and teach each other to solve thses problems.

Class on 16-Jan-2022: Covered chapter 1.

Homework 1: (Group Homework, Deadline 30-Jan-2022 at 00:00 Phnom Penh time)

1. Exercise 8 in section 3.

2. Exercise 15 in section 5.

3. Exercise 11 in section 8.

4. Exercise 6 in section 11.

5. Exercise 7 in section 11.

6. Prove that a set $S$ is closed if and only if $S$ contains each of its accumulation points if and only if the closure of $S$ is $S$ if and only if the complement of $S$ ( that is $\mathbb{C}\setminus S$) is open.

7. Prove that the sets $(b)$ and $(d)$ in exercise 1 of section 11 are domains and the set in exercise 5 of section 11 is not a domain. Find the closures of thses domains.

8. Exercise 10 in section 11.

Class on 30-Jan-2022: Covered chapter 2 (section 12-16)

Homework 2: (Group Homework, Deadline 13-Feb-2022 at 00:00 Phnom Penh time)

1. Prove that if $in S\subset \mathbb{C}$ is an accumulation point then there exists a sequence in $S$ that converges to $z_0$.

2. Prove that $\lim\limits_{z\to z_0}f(z)=w_0$ if and only if $\forall\epsilon>0,\forall N\in \mathbb{N},\exists\delta>0$ such that $|f(z)-w_0|< N\epsilon$ whenever $0<|z-z_0|<\delta$.

3. Prove that $\lim\limits_{z\to z_0}f(z)=w_0$ if and only if $\forall\epsilon>0,\forall N\in \mathbb{N},\exits\delta>0$ such that $|f(z)-w_0|< \frac{\epsilon}{N}$ whenever $0<|z-z_0|<\delta$.

4. By using definition, prove that $\lim\limits_{z\to z_0}z^2={z_0}^2$.

5. Exercise 4 in section 14.

6. Exercise 7 in section 14.
