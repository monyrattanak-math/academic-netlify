title: A Moment Map for the T-action and Commuting Toeplitz Operators acting on Bergman Spaces of the Bounded Symmetric Domain of Type IV
event: Seminar on Toeplitz Operators, CINVESTAV
event_url: ""
location: Virtual
# summary: An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: "We will introduce the recent class of symbols related to a moment map. First, we will compute a moment map for the T-action on the n-dimensional Cartan domain of type IV. We will prove that Toeplitz operators with moment map symbols of the SO(2)-action generate commutative C*-algebras on every Bergman spaces with weight greater than n-1. Futhermore, we will provide the explicit spectal integral formula for such Toeplitz operators."
