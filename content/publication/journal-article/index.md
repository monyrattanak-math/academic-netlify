abstract: Let us consider, for $n \geq 3$, the Cartan domain $D^{IV}_n$ of type IV. On the weighted Bergman spaces $A^2_\lambda(D^{IV}_n)$ we study the problem of the existence of commutative $C^*$-algebra generated by Toeplitz operators with special symbols. denoted by $L^{\infty}(D^{IV}_n)^{\mu^{SO(2)}}$, yield Toeplitz operators that generate commutative $C^*$-algebras. Spectral integral formulas for these Toeplitz operators are also obtained.
