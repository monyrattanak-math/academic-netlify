abstract: Let us consider, for $n ≥ 3$, the Cartan domain $D^{IV}_n$ of type IV. On the weighted Bergman spaces $A^2_\lamda(D^{IV}_n)$ we study the problem of the existence of commutative $C^*$-algebras generated by Toeplitz operators with special symbols. We focus on the subgroup $SO(n) \times SO(2)$ of biholomorphisms of $D^{IV}_n$ that fix the origin. The $SO(n) \times SO(2)$-invariant symbols yield Toeplitz operators that generate commutative $C^*$-algebras, but commutativity is lost when we consider symbols invariant under a maximal torus or under $SO(2)$. We compute the moment map $\mu^{SO(2)}$ for the $SO(2)$-action on $D^{IV}_n$ considered as a symplectic manifold for the Bergman metric. We prove that the space of symbols of the form $a = f \circ \mu^{SO(2)}, denoted by $L^{\infty}(D^{IV}_n)^{mu^{SO(2)}}$, yield Toeplitz operators that generate commutative $C*$-algebras. Spectral integral formulas for these Toeplitz operators are also obtained.
