abstract: Let us consider, for $n ≥ 3$, the Cartan domain $${D_n}^{IV}$$ of type IV. On The Weighted Bergman Spaces $A^2_\Lamda(D^{Iv}_N)$ We Study The Problem Of The Existence Of Commutative $C^*$-Algebras Generated By Toeplitz Operators With Special Symbols. We Focus On The Subgroup $So(N) \Times So(2)$ Of Biholomorphisms Of $D^{Iv}_N$ That Fix The Origin. The $So(N) \Times So(2)$-Invariant Symbols Yield Toeplitz Operators That Generate Commutative $C^*$-Algebras, But Commutativity Is Lost When We Consider Symbols Invariant Under A Maximal Torus Or Under $SO(2)$. We Compute The Moment Map $\Mu^{So(2)}$ For The $So(2)$-Action On $D^{Iv}_N$ Considered As A Symplectic Manifold For The Bergman Metric. We Prove That The Space Of Symbols Of The Form $A = F \Circ \Mu^{So(2)}, Denoted By $L^{\Infty}(D^{Iv}_N)^{Mu^{So(2)}}$, Yield Toeplitz Operators That Generate Commutative $C*$-Algebras. Spectral Integral Formulas For These Toeplitz Operators Are Also Obtained.
