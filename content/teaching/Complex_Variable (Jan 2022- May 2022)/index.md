This is a one semester course on complex variables for MAC students cohort I. The reference used in the course is "COMPLEX VARIABLES AND APPLICATIONS, 8th edition" by James Ward Brown and Ruel V. Churchill. This course is intended to cover at least from chapter 1 to chapter 7.

The following is the link to join the class:

The homework have to be sent to my email (found it in About) with only one pdf file under the name "ComplexV_HW1" and so on. You are expected to work together and teach each other to solve thses problems.

Class on 16-Jan-2022: Covered chapter 1.

Homework 1: (Group Homework, Deadline 30-Jan-2022 at 00:00 Phnom Penh time)

1. Exercise 8 in section 3.

2. Exercise 15 in section 5.

3. Exercise 11 in section 8.

4. Exercise 6 in section 11.

5. Exercise 7 in section 11.

6. Prove that a set $S$ is closed if and only if $S$ contains each of its accumulation points if and only if the closure of $S$ is $S$ if and only if the complement of $S$ ( that is $\mathbb{C}\setminus S$) is open.

7. Prove that the sets $(b)$ and $(d)$ in exercise 1 of section 11 are domains and the set in exercise 5 of section 11 is not a domain. Find the closures of thses domains.

8. Exercise 10 in section 11.

Homework 2: (Group Homework, Deadline 13-Feb-2022 at 00:00 Phnom Penh time)

1. Give an example of a boundary point that is not an accumulation point. This exercise shows that the set of accumulation points of a set $S$ is not the union of $S$ with its boundary (this corrects an error in the class). In fact, $S'\subset S\cup \patial S$.

2. Prove that $z$ is in the closure of a set $S$ if and only if each neighbourhood of $z$ contains at least on point in $S$. This exercise shows the difference between the closure point and the accumulation point.

3. Prove that the closure of a set is the smallest closed set containing that set. This exercise gives another equivalent definition of the closure of a set.

4. A complex sequence $z_n$ coverges to $z$ if $\forall \epsilon>0,\exists N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $|z_n -z|< \epsilon$ whenever $n \geq N$. Prove that if $z_0 \in S\subset \mathbb{C}$ is an accumulation point then there exists a sequence in $S$ that converges to $z_0$. This is the reason that in some book, an accumulation point is called a limit point.

5. Prove that $\lim\limits_{z\to z_0}f(z)=w_0$ if and only if $\forall\epsilon>0,\forall N\in \mathbb{N},\exists\delta>0$ such that $|f(z)-w_0|< N\epsilon$ whenever $0<|z-z_0|<\delta$.

6. Prove that $\lim\limits_{z\to z_0}f(z)=w_0$ if and only if $\forall\epsilon>0,\forall N\in \mathbb{N},\exists\delta>0$ such that $|f(z)-w_0|< \frac{\epsilon}{N}$ whenever $0<|z-z_0|<\delta$.
