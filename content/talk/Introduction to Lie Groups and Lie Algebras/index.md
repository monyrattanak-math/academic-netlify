title: Introduction to Lie Groups and Lie Algebras
event: Mathematics Seminar
event_url: ""
location: Royal University of Phnom Penh, Cambodia
# summary: An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: "In this talk, I gave some motivations why a Norwegian mathematician Marius Sophus Lie (1842-1899) interested in Lie groups and Lie algebras. After that, I introduced Lie groups and Lie algebras by providing simple definitions and some basic examples. Finally, I provided some applications of Lie groups and Lie algebras."
