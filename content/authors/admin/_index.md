I hold a bachelor degree in mathematics from Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP), Cambodia. I pursued and obtained my postgraduate degrees from Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas (CIMAT), Mexico under direction of <a href="https://www.cimat.mx/~quiroga/" target="_blank"> Dr. Raúl Quiroga Barranco</a>. 

My master thesis: <a href="https://cimat.repositorioinstitucional.mx/jspui/bitstream/1008/732/1/TE%20639.pdf" target="_blank"> Matrix Lie Groups and Lie Correspondences</a> is about Lie groups that are subgroups or isomorphic to subgroups of general linear group and relations to their Lie algebras.
