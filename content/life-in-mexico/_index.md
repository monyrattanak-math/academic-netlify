# Mexico's Stereotype in Cambodia
date: "2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00"
Mexico? Where is Mexico? When talking about Mexico, Khmer people almost know nothing but drugs. Back to more then ten years ago, there was a Mexican drama called "Marimar". This serie was very famous in Cambodia that time and the names of a man who loves Marimar, translated in Khmer: Sochio and her dog : Kako were used frequently in comedy shows.

When I was accepted to pursue my master degree in Mexico, I had no idea where it is until I searched in Google map to see that it is below USA on the map. I thought that Mexican speaks Mexican language and it turned out that they speak Spanish  and only think I knew about Mexico was drug dealers.

My neighbors asked my mom if it was safe in Mexico and some even asked if Mexico was a state of USA. In fact, I had no ideas. I checked online to see whether Guanajuato (I didn't know how to pronounce it) was safe or not and the result was it is one of the safe states in Mexico. Looked on some photos and videos of Guanajuato, OK! I just loved it, loved the colorful it is and I wanted to go there. I thought that if it was dangerous, I just go to school and return to house.

# Flight Tickets and Mexican Visas

Why Mexico? After finished my master degree  in Cambodia, I was one of the top 5 in the program so professors from France helped us find scholarship for (standard) master degree abroad. They suggested some scholarships in France for the first rank and CIMAT, Mexico for the other four. This was a first time they recommended Mexico and there was no one pursue higher degree in math at Mexico before. So, I decided to apply for master degree in Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas (CIMAT), Guanajuato, Mexico with other 3 friends. Be the one or among the first went to a country that most Cambodian (Khmer) don't even know or visit was cool, wasn't it?

After 2 months of applied for scholarship, my friends and I got accepted to pursue master degree in basic mathematics (pure math). It was mention about salary and the programs. Also, we would learn Spanish one semester before started master degree program. I accepted the scholarship even I didn't even know how to say "Hello" in Spanish. I just thought that maybe Spanish was not that hard or maybe we could speak English?... there would be a way. Maybe I too believed on myself? Maybe I was careless, innocent?

However, this decision was adventure. There is no Mexican embassy in Cambodia. Where could we get Mexican visas? Also we had to find a fight iteration for CIMAT so they could pay us but how?

As mention that I never went abroad, so I just downloaded application and find flights from Cambodia to Mexico. There were a lot of cheap flights which all transit in USA. I just chose the cheapest one until my best friend called me from Australia and told me that I needed transit visa to pass thought USA and had to apply for it. Upp, it was not easy anymore. I didn't even know how to get Mexican visa and now USA transit visa? How greedy USA?

I did research again to find good (affordable) fights passed thought counties don't need transit visas. After a week of searching, I found a good one but it was a long journey. It was from Cambodia to Malaysia to Germany and to Mexico city. After that there would be a person from CIMAT waited for us and drove us to Guanajuato. It was in total around 40 hours.

How about Mexican visas? We followed a suggestion from French professor to go to Mexican embassy in Vietnam. A short Journey but it was the first time on an airplane. I got carsick but maybe it was OK on airplane or even worse?

# A Journey to Vietnam

We booked flights and hotel for 3 days 2 nights in VN. The flight was from Cambodia to Lao (transit) to Hanoi (VN). This was my first flight and my first time on airplane. What happened? I was OK when the flight took off but when it landed on, I was uncomfortable and felt like my stomach move upward. I vomited when it landed on in Lao and again in VN. After arrived at airport, there was a car from hotel has waited for us. From airport to hotel, I vomited again but this time, there was almost nothing came out. I was exhausted. We arrived at hotel almost night and it was cool (also there was light raining). We were hungry so much so that after leaved our stuff in hotel, we decided to find something to eat nearby. We found a street food we wanted. There was beef in hot pot with vegetables and sauce. It was very delicious (under that situation) but we spent almost 70 USD for that steet food. It very expensive compare to the same/similar food in Cambodia. We thought they cheat us but we had no choice and also the don't speak English and neither of us speak vietnamese. We asked someone in hotel when we went back and he told it was expensive and he told us where we could find something to eat. What a day!

Tomorrow morning, we went to Mexican embassy by taxi. The taxi driver and the locals don't speak English. On the way to embassy, I vomited again. The taxi driver seem didn't care about me. He just drove as fast as bad as he used to (what I thought). We were interviewed one by one at Mexican embassy and obtained visas the same day. Our work was done and we wanted to know more about VN.

Mostly we ate at restaurants they speak English. Luckily, my friend has a friend lived in VN for study. So we met up and our lives were better. We went to market to buy something and ate in affordable restaurants. However, everything there was more expensive than in Cambodia. We went back and I worried about the flight back. As I thought, I vomited 2 times again in Lao and Cambodia. I was worry about a long jurney to Mexico. Unexpectedly, an American woman approched me, when we landed on in Cambodia, and told me that there are bracelets to prevent movement sickness. I didn't know anything about that but this was the only hope.

For me, I don't like their lifestyle (local Vietnamese) and the surrounding, the way they treat foreigners and the way they drive but this is just a part of VN and in fact there are many places in VN people recommend. After that, we realized we could process visas in Thailand, and we thought that it would be more fun than in VN. This was because we followed the advice from French professor and we had no ideas (non of us went aboard before) as this was our first time. However, everythig ocure for reason.

# A Journey to Mexico

A flight to Mexico was transit in Malaysia (about 11 hours) then transit in Germany (about 6 hours) and we arrived Mexico city at night. There was a person from CIMAT had waited for us at airport and drove us to Guanajuato. According to this journey, I would had vomit 4 times. I was afraid and my only holp was bracelets an American recommended. I didn't know where to buy them but forturnately, I found them. Did they help?

Another problem came, I had to prepare my stuffs in a luggage to weight at most 23 kg. 23 kg? only 23? I needed more but not for my clothes or shoes but foods. I brought a lot of foods such as beef and pork sausages, dry pork, rice noodles, some sauce and ingredients etc... etc... I had no ideas about Mexican foods so that I had to prepare for the first week or month in Mexico before I got used to the foods. I prepared well but unforturnately, I didn't review about foods restriction into Mexico. Before leaved the airport in Mexico city, we were ask to open our luggages but I had no idea why they didn't speak English. It is an international airport. Were they just kidding me? A woman took out my foods and just ask me "chicken?" (she just spoke a little English as she knew that I didn't speak Spanish). I didn't like chicken so I didn't bring it and took away all my meats and some ingredient with seeds. It was like she took away an icecream from a little kid and I just watched it without knowing how to say. I only had some package of noodle, rice and some ingredients. How sad!

Return to bracelets, they worked. I didn't know how they worked but they did. They saved my life. I didn't vomit or even felt uncomtable and I was really thankful for that American woman. Of course, we all were exhausted because of a very long journey. We arrived at Guanajuato at night and it was very cold (for me at that time because it is very hot in Cambodia). We stayed at Cimatel prepared by CIMAT. A problem was that we all were hungry but it was night and we didn't speak Spanish. What could we do? Did we pass a night without eating?
