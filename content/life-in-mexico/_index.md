This is my life experiences about Mexico.

# Mexico's Stereotype in Cambodia

Mexico? Where is Mexico? When talking about Mexico, Khmer people almost know nothing but drugs. Back to more then ten years ago, there was a Mexican drama called "Marimar". This serie was very famous in Cambodia that time and the names of a man who loves Marimar, translated in Khmer: Sochio and her dog : Kako were used frequently in comedy shows.

When I was accepted to pursue my master degree in Mexico, I had no idea where it is until I searched in Google map to see that it is below USA on the map. I thought that Mexican speaks Mexican language and it turned out that they speak Spanish  and only think I knew about Mexico was drug dealers.

My neighbors asked my mom if it was safe in Mexico and some even asked if Mexico was a state of USA. In fact, I had no ideas. I checked online to see whether Guanajuato (I didn't know how to pronounce it) was safe or not and the result was it is one of the safe states in Mexico. Looked on some photos and videos of Guanajuato, OK! I just loved it, loved the colorful it is and I wanted to go there. I thought that if it was dangerous, I just go to school and return to house.

# Before Arrived Mexico

Why Mexico? After finished my master degree  in Cambodia, I was one of the top 5 in the program so professors from France helped us find scholarship for (standard) master degree abroad. They suggested some scholarships in France for the first rank and CIMAT, Mexico for the other four. This was a first time they recommended Mexico and there was no one pursue higher degree in math at Mexico before. So, I decided to apply for master degree in Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas (CIMAT), Guanajuato, Mexico with other 3 friends. Be the one or among the first went to a country that most Cambodian (Khmer) don't even know or visit was cool, wasn't it?

After 2 months of applied for scholarship, my friends and I got accepted to pursue master degree in basic mathematics (pure math). It was mention about salary and the programs. Also, we would learn Spanish one semester before started master degree program. I accepted the scholarship even I didn't even know how to say "Hello" in Spanish. I just thought that maybe Spanish was not that hard or maybe we could spoke English?... there would be a way. Maybe I too believed on myself? Maybe I was careless, innocent?

However, this decision was adventure. There is no Mexican embassy in Cambodia. Where could we get Mexican visas? Also we had to find a fight iteration for CIMAT so they could pay us but how?

As mention that I never went abroad, so I just downloaded application and find flights from Cambodia to Mexico. There were a lot of cheap flights which all transit in USA. I just chose the cheapest one until my best friend called me from Australia and told me that I needed transit visa to pass thought USA and had to apply for it. Upp, it was not easy anymore. I didn't even know how to get Mexican visa and now USA transit visa? How greedy USA?

I did research again to find good (affordable) fights pass thought counties don't need transit visas. After a week of searching, I found a good one but it was a long journey. It was from Cambodia to Malaysia to Germany and to Mexico city. After that there would be a person from CIMAT waited for us and drove us to Guanajuato. It was in total around 40 hours.

How about Mexican visas? We followed a suggestion from French professor to go to Mexican embassy in Vietnam. A short Journey but it was the first time on an airplane. I got carsick but maybe it was OK on airplane or even worse?
